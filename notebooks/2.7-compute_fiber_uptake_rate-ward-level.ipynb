    "Given that the ookla speed tests are recorded only where there is speed test server, the dataset available does not represent the entire fixed broadband usage in all South Africa. In addition, the speed test dataset is roughtly 48K devices for fixed broadband while according to [Mybroadband](https://mybroadband.co.za/news/fibre/482845-south-africas-biggest-fibre-networks.html), about 1.5 million households are connected with fiber. All this points to the fact that we are dealing with sample data from each municipalities.\n",
    "\n",
    "To ensure we obtain a distribution that is very similar to the population distribution, descriptive statistics such as mean and standard deviation of the population should be known. According to [Statssa](https://www.statssa.gov.za/?p=15473#:~:text=In%202021%2C%20South%20Africa%20had,size%20of%203%2C34%20persons.), South Africa has approximately 18 million house holds. Also, from the [2021 SOuth Africa General Household Survey - page 52](https://www.statssa.gov.za/publications/P0318/P03182021.pdf), 17.2% of metropolitan households have access to internet at home while it was just 1.2% for the rural areas.\n",

    "- *Using the urban/rural divide for home internet for metropolitan and rural households, we can compute for the standard deviation about the mean. This standard deviation can be assumed to be the standard deviation for South Africa fiber uptake rate*\n",
    "\n",
    "With the current uptake rate from the available dataset, the two metrics used both have a mean and a standard deviation that is less than 1. Having made the above assumptions, the aim is to transform the current distribution of the computed uptake rates so that its average and standard deviation is the same with that of the population. This transformation will not change the underlying distribution, rather it just shift the mean to the desired position and spread the distribution by the assumed standard deviation of the population.\n",
    "\n",
    "From **linear transformation**, adding a constant to each value in a distribution will increase/decrease the mean of the distribution to the direction of the constant but the standard deviation of the distribution remains thesame(unchanged). Multiplying each value in a distribution by a constant, the new mean will be equal to the product of the constant and the old mean. Also, the new standard deviation will be equal to the porduct of the constant and the old standard deviation. Further reading can be done [here](https://stattrek.com/random-variable/transformation#:~:text=A%20linear%20transformation%20is%20a,the%20variable%20by%20a%20constant.)\n",
